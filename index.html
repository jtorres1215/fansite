			<p>God Of War is a featured game back in 2005 on the ps2 until 2018 came around with the new and improvement God Of War but its a different story from 2005-2018 Kratos has traveled throughout Greece and then moved from Greece to another land far,far away just to hide his background story that everyone heard.Im gonna tel you a story about Kratos because I played God Of War myself and looked and listened carefully to the story.</p>
