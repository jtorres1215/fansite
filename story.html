	<h1>Stories of Kratos's Past</h1>
		<div id="main">
			<p>In the story of Kratos,he was born a demi-god and his father is Zeus and her mother is Callisto(Spartan Woman) and he also had a brother named Deimos.<p>At the age of 7 Kratos is taken by the spartan warriors to be trained to be a true Spartan and years later he became a Spartan leader,Kratos married a Spartan woman named Lysandra and had a kid named Calliope.These wars with different cities keep on and on.</p>His wife asked Kratos "How much is enough Kratos? When will it end?" Kratos said "when the glory of Sparta is known to others."She responded back "the glory of Sparta....you did this for yourself!"He didn't listen and he went on battling against the Barbarian's but alas Kratos and his army failed but before Kratos almost died he asked for Ares help to destroy his enemies and in return Kratos will serve Ares and then when it was all done Ares gave Kratos the Blades and Chaos and ultimate power but it seems that power took over him.All around the city of Greece he has been killing innocent people and worse... his family.<p>In a sad suprise Kratos was wondering why are they here if they was in Sparta but it was Ares who led them here and he was cursed that the ashes of his family was into his skin,never to be removed and he became the Ghost of Sparta and his mission is to kill Ares and so he did in a long journey.</p><p>He became the god of war and he was set out in a journey to find his brother Deimos and he did but Deimos tried to kill him because he never attempted to rescue him but then Thanatos took him and they are working together and Kratos apologized to Demios but during the battle Demios died and Kratos unleashed his rage to kill Thanatos.More info if you click on this video!</p><iframe width="650" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jugFCrXe5Y4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
